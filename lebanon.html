            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                In Lebanon, children have endured months of unrest and loss. Help is urgently needed to recover, to
                accommodate refugee families and to support overcrowded hospitals.
            </p>

            <p>The armed conflict in Lebanon has caused many victims. Schools, hospitals, and homes have been destroyed
                or damaged in the violence. Since October 2023, more than 200 children have died. More than a million
                people have fled in search of safer places. Some people are going home, but there is great damage to the
                infrastructure they need. And some have no home to go back to. </p>

            <h2>The Challenges</h2>
            <p>
                In Lebanon, the population is facing crisis after crisis. The current conflict comes on top of an economic and political crisis that has been going on for years.

                A million people have been displaced, including many children. They are dependent on humanitarian aid.
                Children in Lebanon have been traumatized by loss, injuries and shocking experiences. Many are still afraid, have lost their home, or are still unable to go to school. 
                Humanitarian needs are still great: from shelter to access to clean water and from health care to sanitation facilities such as toilets.
