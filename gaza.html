            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                The war in Gaza has killed more than 14,000 children since October 2023. No place in Gaza is safe for
                children. They live in fear every moment of the day. Fear of violence, fear of losing loved ones and
                fear for their future. For a year now. Children in the West Bank are also affected.
            </p>

            <p>In the Gaza Strip, almost 9 out of 10 people are displaced, and many of them have had to flee several times. They stay in overcrowded places without enough basic facilities such as shelter, clean water, and food. Aid from organizations such as UNICEF is only possible to a limited extent. Violence is no longer the only threat to the children:â€¯ 

                Too little food threatens a famine;
                Life-threatening diseases spread quickly due to a lack of clean water and sanitation; 
                Children who are sick or injured often cannot receive the necessary care because many hospitals no longer function and there is a shortage of medical resources;
                An estimated 17,000 children are completely alone or separated from their parents and family; 
                Children have already missed out on more than a year of education. 
                The war also affects children in the West Bank, threatening their mental and physical well-being. </p>

            <h2>The Challenges</h2>
            <p>
                Gaza faces significant challenges, including genocide, poverty, and lack of access to basic
                resources.
                Many children are unable to attend school or receive adequate healthcare, putting their life at risk.
