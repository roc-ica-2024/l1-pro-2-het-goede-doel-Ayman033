            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                The forgotten conflict in Sudan threatens the future of millions of children. More than five million
                children have been displaced. Children are exposed to dangers of exploitation and violence on a daily
                basis. UNICEF continues to present and provide assistance in Sudan and the surrounding countries to
                which people have fled. From water and medicine to help with malnutrition and vaccinations.
            </p>

            <p>On April 15, 2023, a conflict unexpectedly broke out in Sudan. To this day, there is heavy fighting, and
                the country also has to deal with climate disasters such as drought and floods. A large part of the
                population is now dependent on humanitarian aid, including 14 million children. They have to deal with
                hunger, outbreaks of diseases such as cholera and polio and violence. There is a shortage of clean
                water, food, and lack of health care. The children of Sudan are in urgent need of humanitarian aid,
                protection and peace. UNICEF is calling for a humanitarian ceasefire and access to people in need so
                that we can help as many people as possible. . </p>

            <p>
                South Sudan faces significant challenges, including conflict, poverty, and lack of access to basic
                resources.
                Many children are unable to attend school or receive adequate healthcare, putting their future at risk.
