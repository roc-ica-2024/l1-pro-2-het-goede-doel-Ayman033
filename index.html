            <p> UNICEF, the United Nations agency for children, works to protect the rights of every child, especially
                the
                most disadvantaged and those hardest to reach. Across more than 190 countries and territories, we do
                whatever it takes to help children survive, thrive and fulfil their potential.

                We provide and advocate for education, health and nutrition services. Protect children from violence and
                abuse. Bring clean water and sanitation to those in need. And keep them safe from climate change and
                disease.

                <p>Helping children in South Sudan.</p>
                <a> The forgotten conflict in Sudan threatens the future of millions of children. More than five million
                    children have been displaced. Children are exposed to dangers of exploitation and violence on a daily
                    basis. The children in Sudan need our help.</a>

                <p>The armed conflict in Lebanon has caused many victims. Schools, hospitals, and homes have been destroyed
                    or damaged in the violence. Since October 2023, more than 200 children have died. More than a million
                    people have fled in search of safer places.</a>

                <p>Crisis in Gaza</p>
                <a > The war in Gaza has killed more than 14,000 children since October 2023. No place in Gaza is safe for
                    children. They live in fear every moment of the day. Fear of violence, fear of losing loved ones and
                    fear for their future. For a year now. Children in the West Bank are also affected.</a>
