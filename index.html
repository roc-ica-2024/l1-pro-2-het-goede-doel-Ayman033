        <div class="text">

            <p> UNICEF, the United Nations agency for children, works to protect the rights of every child, especially
                the
                most disadvantaged and those hardest to reach. Across more than 190 countries and territories, we do
                whatever it takes to help children survive, thrive and fulfil their potential.

                We provide and advocate for education, health and nutrition services. Protect children from violence and
                abuse. Bring clean water and sanitation to those in need. And keep them safe from climate change and
                disease.

                        facilities, such as hospitals, vaccinations, malnutrition screening, clean water and sanitation.
                        We monitor violations of children's rights. In calmer areas, we provide basic services such as
                        health care, water, education, and psychosocial care. We provide safe child-friendly spaces and
                        help refugees in neighboring countries with clean water, healthcare, education, malnutrition and
                        psychosocial support.

                    <p class="fixed-text">UNICEF was already present in Lebanon and was therefore able to provide rapid
                        assistance in the event of escalations. We deliver medical supplies, provide vaccinations, and
                        provide clean water and hygiene packages. In addition, we support children with psychosocial
                        help, education, and relaxation. In affected areas, we are repairing water and sanitation
                        facilities to restore access to clean water.

                    <p class="fixed-text">UNICEF remains in Gaza, providing assistance to children despite limited
                        access and insecurity, such as malnutrition treatment, clean water and medicines. The number of
                        children in need is extremely high, so more help is urgently needed. With the ceasefire, we can
                        help on a larger scale. We are also providing aid in the West Bank, working with other
                        organisations and local partners to increase and provide effective aid.</p>
